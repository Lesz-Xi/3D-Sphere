## About

Sphere Physics is an interactive 3D physics simulation that features a wireframe sphere containing multiple bouncing balls. The simulation demonstrates basic physics principles like collision detection, gravity, and momentum in a visually striking minimalist design.

## How to Use

- The simulation runs automatically when loaded.
- Watch as the balls bounce and collide within the rotating sphere.
- The wireframe rendering provides a clear view of all interactions.
- Observe how the balls interact with each other and the sphere's inner faces.

## Tech

- React & Next.js
- Three.js for 3D rendering
- React Three Fiber for React integration
- React Three Rapier for physics simulation
- Post-processing effects for wireframe rendering
- Tailwind CSS for styling

## Features

- Wireframe rendering of 3D objects
- Real-time physics simulation
- Multiple colored balls with collision detection
- Rotating sphere container
- Post-processing outline effects
- Responsive design
